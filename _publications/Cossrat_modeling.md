This paper introduces a Cosserat rod based mathematical model for modeling a self-controllable variable curvature soft continuum robot. This soft continuum robot can then perform continuous curvature variation, unlike previous approaches whose curvature variation is discrete and depends on the number of locking mechanisms or manual configurations. The robot poses an emergent modeling problem due to the variable stiffness growing spine which is addressed in this paper. We investigate the property of growing spine stiffness and incorporate it into the Cosserat rod model by implementing a combined stiffness approach. We conduct experiments with the soft continuum robot in various configurations and compared the results with our developed mathematical model.
