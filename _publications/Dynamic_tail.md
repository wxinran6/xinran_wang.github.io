This paper presents the design of a four degree-of-freedom (DoF) spatial tail and demonstrates the dynamic stabilization of a bipedal robotic platform through a hardware-in-loop simulation. The proposed tail design features three active revolute joints with an active prismatic joint, the latter of which provides a variable moment of inertia. Real-time experimental results validate the derived mathematical model when compared to simulated reactive moment results, both obtained while executing a pre-determined trajectory. A 4-DoF tail prototype was constructed and the tail dynamics, in terms of reactive force and moments, were validated using a 6-axis load cell. The paper also presents a case study where a zero moment point (ZMP) placement-based trajectory planner, along with a model-based controller, was developed in order for the tail to stabilize a simulated unstable biped robot. The case study also demonstrates the capability of the motion planner and controller in reducing the systemâ€™s kinetic energy during periods of instability by maintaining ZMP within the support polygon of the host biped robot. Both experimental and simulation results show an improvement in the tail-generated reactive moments for robot stabilization through the inclusion of prismatic motion while executing complex trajectories.
